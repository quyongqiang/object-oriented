# class
attribute define + method define + static data(class var) + static method(class method)

# object = instance of a class
(a piece of new memory have some initialized data and a pointer that point to its class)

# function vs method
function: out of class, such as built-in functions, print.
method: in a class, can be instace method or class method.

# binding
after initialization, let instance connect to its class.
the initialize process is binding process.
